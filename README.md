## DevOps & Cybersecurity Enthusiast | From Content to Code

Social Media Strategist transitioning to DevOps Engineer. I combine communication expertise with technical innovation to build scalable digital solutions. With roots in marketing, finance, and photography, I'm transforming my passion for IT into my profession.

My military background has shaped my discipline and determination. Currently, I'm focused on:
- Container Management & Orchestration
- Cloud Infrastructure & Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- IT Process Automation
- Cybersecurity Practices & Ethical Hacking

In my homelab, I develop hands-on projects to continuously expand my skills. I'm particularly fascinated by the intersection of DevOps practices and security concepts.

My goal is to leverage my strategic mindset and technical skills in cybersecurity to protect critical infrastructures and make a positive contribution to digital security.
