## 💼 Professional Background

**Military → Finance → Cybersecurity**

Former **Bundeswehr** (German Armed Forces) service member who spent 5 years as **Social Media Manager @ BDK Bank (Société Générale)**—automated 60% of reporting workflows, grew followers 200%, led cross-functional infrastructure projects.

Now converting 5 years of data-driven automation and crisis communication expertise into secure, scalable infrastructure. Because you can't effectively secure what you don't understand—and modern infrastructure is DevOps infrastructure.

**What makes me different:**
- **Military discipline** applied to security operations
- **Communication skills** rare in tech—translate CVEs into business value
- **Production experience** before first job—built what most teams inherit
- **BSI Grundschutz** knowledge for German market
- **Learning in public**—all work documented and visible
